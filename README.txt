This application consists of three main GUI components - the Customer GUI, the Administrator GUI, and the Garage Terminal GUI. They will work together by communicating with the Parking Management database in a client-server fashion.

To run the Customer GUI component from Visual Studio:
1) Ensure ParkingManagement.CustomerProgram is selected as the project's startup object (can be set under Properties for the project).
2) Clean and run project.

To run the Admin GUI component from Visual Studio:
1) Ensure ParkingManagement.AdminProgram is selected as the project's startup object.
2) Clean and run project.

To run the Terminal GUI component from Visual Studio:
1) Ensure ParkingManagement.TerminalProgram is selected as the project's startup object.
2) Clean and run project.

===============================================================

For the Administrator and Terminal GUI components, it is hard to test out the functionality without a test environment. Test programs have been created for this purpose.

To test the Admin GUI component from Visual Studio:
1) Ensure ParkingManagement.Test.AdminProgramTest is selected as the project's startup object.
2) Clean and run project.

To run the Terminal GUI component from Visual Studio:
1) Ensure ParkingManagement.Test.TerminalProgramTest is selected as the project's startup object.
